# ðŸ‘‹ Hello Angular

Hello folks, are you planning to start working with real time angular projects:


Here is a list of angular assignments I have designed to help you get started:
```
ðŸ’¡ Pro tip: How you should study a topic
Let's suppose you are starting with Reactive form
1. What is reactive form?
2. Type of forms in angular.
3. Validating input values (ex: Required Validator, Email Validator, Compare two values, file types, ...)
4. Adding form elements dynamically (advance topic, you can skip if you want)
```
### Topics Coverd
1. Reactive Form
2. Routing
3. Local Storage
4. Http Client

### Assignments
1. Create a [Reactive form](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-8-reactive-form-validation) and add validations to it. HTML elments to include in the form can be found [here](https://codepen.io/jitangupta/pen/RwoLexj).
2. Consume an API and send form data to server with help of [HttpClient]().
3. Create another component and add route for it, add a `RouterLink` for redirection. Send dynamic values to route and read them. Send parameters and read them.
4.
